# Secret Santa leveraging Elysia with React frontend, Bun runtime and Prisma ORM

This is mostly an experiment. The application does not leverage either of the toolkit completly. 
React is only used for one part of the application and with server rendering.

## Getting Started
To get started with this template, simply paste this command into your terminal:
```bash
bun create elysia ./elysia-example
```

## Development
To start the development server run:
```bash
bun run dev
```

Open http://localhost:3000/ with your browser to see the result.

## Deployment
This app can be deployed on [fly.io](https://fly.io) with the following command:
```bash
fly launch
fly deploy
```
